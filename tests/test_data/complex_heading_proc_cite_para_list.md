This is the start of the _first_ paragraph. This is the second sentence.
Third sentence, after a LINEBREAK. The fourth sentence starts a list:
  1 This is the first list item.
  2 Another item
  3 Last item.
The paragraph continues.

This is para2. And, this is a new paragraph with only a single sentence.

## This is our procedure

2. Do that:
